## Layout Features

- **Card-Based Design**: Content is organized in clearly defined cards with shadows and hover effects
- **Material Design Influences**: Subtle elevation, transitions, and consistent typography
- **Flat Design Elements**: Clean, minimal aesthetic with purposeful use of color
- **Responsive Grid System**: Adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- **Enhanced Sidebar**: Styled sidebar with improved navigation and visual hierarchy

## How to Use

1. **Run with Card Layout:**
   ```
   streamlit run main_card_layout.py
   ```

2. **Toggle Between Layouts:**
   - Once logged in, use the checkbox in the sidebar to switch between traditional and card-based layouts

3. **Layout Components API:**
   ```python
   # Import the card layout utilities
   from utils.card_layout import create_card, create_grid, zen_section
   
   # Create a section header
   zen_section("Section Title", "Optional description", "Optional emoji icon")
   
   # Create a responsive grid
   columns = create_grid(num_columns=2)  # Adjust for device type as needed
   
   # Add cards to the grid
   with columns[0]:  # First column
       create_card(
           title="Card Title",
           icon="ðŸ§ ",  # Optional emoji icon
           content="<p>HTML content for the card body</p>",
           footer_content="<button>Optional footer button</button>",
           key="unique_card_id",
           on_click=lambda: handle_card_click()  # Optional click handler
       )
   ```

## Design Considerations

This implementation balances several key design principles:

1. **Professional Aesthetics**: Clean, business-appropriate visuals without trendy elements
2. **Information Hierarchy**: Clear visual distinction between different types of content
3. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: White space and card separation make information easier to process
4. **Accessibility**: High contrast text, clear typography, and adequate touch targets
5. **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes while maintaining usability

This layout is particularly well-suited for the target audience of experienced managers who value efficiency, clarity, and professional presentation.
